  ## Beaches
  
  There are many scenic beaches, including:
  
   - **Oneroa Beach** – The main beach, on the northern side of the town of Oneroa.
   - **Little Oneroa Beach** – A small secluded beach at the east end of Oneroa Beach, separated by a protruding cliff wall.
   - **Palm Beach** – Similar in shape to Oneroa Beach (complete with protruding cliff wall at the east end that separates a small private beach in Boatshed Bay), it gets its name from the mature phoenix palms at the east end.
   - **Little Palm Beach** – A small clothes-optional beach at the west end of Palm Beach.
   - **Blackpool Beach** – The south-facing counterpart of Oneroa Beach, lining Blackpool and popular for kayaking and windsurfing.
   - **Surfdale Beach** – A zoned-in beach on the southern side of Surfdale, separated from Blackpool Beach by a small protruding peninsula, which has a scenic unsealed route called The Esplanade linking the beaches. Popular for kitesurfing.
   - **Onetangi Beach** – A 1.87 km long, north-facing beach lining Onetangi. For many years it has been the site of the Onetangi Beach Races. Its western end, often inaccessible at high tide, is clothes-optional. It has sandcastle building contests annually; participants have a few hours to build their creations in soft sand that is free of shells and suitable for digging.
   - **Cactus Bay** – Considered by many Waihekeans as the most perfect beach and, with nearby Garden Cove, a romantic place for picnicking. The beach is accessible only by boat or kayak, as its land access was blocked off by a private landowner.
