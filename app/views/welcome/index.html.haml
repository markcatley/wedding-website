%p We're very excited to be getting married on Friday the 6th of February 2015. We're heading to Waiheke Island for the occasion and we hope you can join us.
%p We'd love for you to make a weekend of it with us. As it is a public holiday the last ferry returns to Auckland at 11:15 pm and as the wedding doesn't conclude until 1:00 am we would like you to stay on the island. The day after the ceremony we'll be hosting a BBQ lunch from 1:00 pm. Please note that the address has changed.
%p As its over a long weekend and Waiheke Island is a popular destination we would suggest you get onto booking your travel and accommodation. You will find some helpful information on the different pages of our website to assist you with this.
%p If you have anything you'd like to talk to us about please give either of us a call.
%p Craig and Mark
